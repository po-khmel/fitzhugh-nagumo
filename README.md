Analysis of Fitzhugh-Nagumo model of an excitable neuron

The FHN Model is a simplification of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of spike generation in squid giant axons.  
Here I show some results of stability analysis and how the behaviour of the system changes due to variations in the initial parameters and input current.
